# ðŸš§ Project-wide occurrences experimental switch
This repository contains scripts and instructions to build a local switch
containing all that's needed to experiment with the upcoming project-wide
occurrences for OCaml code. Please [report the issues](https://github.com/voodoos/merlin-occurrences-switch/issues)
and misbehaviours that you (probably will) encounter!

## Create a switch to experiment with occurrences

1. Clone this repository
```shell
git clone git@github.com:voodoos/merlin-occurrences-switch.git
```

2. Move to the cloned directory and run `make switch`. This should create a
   local switch with all the necessary pin dependencies.

3. You can then clone a project or create a new one in the same folder as the
   `_opam` folder or in subfolders. This way opam should automatically use the
   new local switch we just created. You will probably need to install your
   project's dependencies in the local switch by calling `opam install .
   --deps-only --with-test`

## Indexation of a dune-based project

1. Enable indexing in your project by creating (or updating) a `dune-workspace`
   file at its root with the following content:
```lisp
(lang dune 3.5)
(workspace_indexation enabled)
```

2. Build the index with
```shell
dune build @uideps
```
(You can also add `--watch` to always rebuild the index.) You can then check the
index's existence: `_build/default/project.uideps`. And even dump its contents
to stdout: `ocaml-uideps dump _build/default/project.uideps`

3. You should now be able to query for the occurrences of any value or type. In
vscode right-click+`Find All References`. In Emacs `M-x merlin-occurrences`.

## Known issues
- Based on 5.1+trunk, your project might not be compatible yet
- Modules in paths (like `A.B.x` are not indexed)
- When the definition of a value cannot be found (like when first-class modules
  are involved), results might be incorrect.
- Aliases modules are considered the same.
- Only usages of a value can be used to find all references not its definition.
- Rough UX, no error messages if the index is absent (you can check that
  `_build/default/project.uideps` exists) or if the index needs a refresh, etc.
- Indexation might show many warnings. Running it twice might me required
  sometimes.
- There are issues with vendoring right now.
